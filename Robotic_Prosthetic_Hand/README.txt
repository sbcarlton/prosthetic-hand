This is a project I have been working on for around a year and a half now, and this is close to the final product. However, before it is completely done I will need to touch up on the code and find an amputee to test it out on. The overall price is a little under $100, it uses 2 servos (1 for the thumb and 1 for the other 4 fingers) and is controlled by a Myoware muscle sensor. I used some more powerful servos for added strength, but standard servos can also be used. The materials are:

I will try to post soon a video on how to assemble the arm, it is fairly simple so I'm sure most people could figure it out, however, there are some tips to putting it together that can make the arm work a bit better and easier to put together.
I strongly support any improvements or modifications to the arm, if you have any I would love to have a look! You can E-mail me at grossrc46468@gmail.com also if you have any questions you can ask me at the same E-mail. Hope you like the project!
